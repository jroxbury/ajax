<h1>JAY-Z - "FuckWithMeYouKnowIGotIt"</h1>
<p class="lyrics">Little over a year ago I was in bondage
And now I'm back out here reaping the blessings
And getting the benefits that go along with it
Everything that's out here for kings like us
The reason why we like this this jewelry and this diamonds and stuff
They don't understand is because we really from Africa
And that's where all this stuff come from
And we originated from kings, you know what I'm saying</p>
